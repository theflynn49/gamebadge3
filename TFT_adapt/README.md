This is a kicad project for an adapter board to install a cheap Aliexpress TZT screen on your GameBadge.

Beware : BenHeck is NOT recommanding this, since cheap display modules may not work well.

On another hand, they cost abour $3 instead of $17 as of today.

I tried these :
 
 - <url>https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005921876295.html</url> (round corners without pixels)
 - <url>https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005933513340.html</url> (not yet tested)

The gerber files should work for PCBway (still waiting for these to arrive)

Have fun.

This is a pre-release, and all this is not fully tested, you have been warned.
